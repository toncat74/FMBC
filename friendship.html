<p> <blockquote>
 What are some good prayers to say?
I come before you, oh Lord, and drink in this moment of peace, that <br>
I may carry something of your hope, love, and joy today in my heart. <br>
Lord, grant me tenacious winsome courage as I go through this day. <br> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
When I am tempted to give up, help me to keep going. <br>
Grant me a cheerful spirit when things don't go my way </p> </blockquote> <br>
  
 <blockquote> <p> May your life be filled with thanksgiving and praise for your countless blessings. <br> 
  Give me assurance that you supply my every need through your generosity. <br>
  May grace, mercy, and peace be with me, from God the Father and from <br
  Jesus Christ the Son,in truth and love. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen <br> </p> </blockquote>
  
 <blockquote> <p> Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; <br>
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and <br>
 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;  <br>
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. <br>  </p> </blockquote>
